# <Cocktail-in-a-Box-Margarita-Selection>
This project displays a fictitious cocktail subscription box website where the user is on the Margarita page. The user is able to look at the different margarita selections and view its ingredients and recipe that goes along with it.
## Description
For this project, I incorporated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users are able to look at the selection of Margaritas on the screen. When they click it, it shows the ingredients and recipe of the drink. Below the recipe the image of the cocktail also appears. 

When the user scrolls down, I incorporated a search input function where the user can type in the name of the cocktail or some of the steps in the recipe and the list of margaritas narrows down to that drink that fits what they are searching for.

Some of the challenges I faced and features I hope to implement in the future for this project is toggling the Margarita names to show and hide the text content of the recipe and ingredients, along with the image. I was researching and many examples I saw online related to having the content already stored in the HTML file, although in this case, I had to fetch this information from an API.
